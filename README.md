# ‚úàÔ∏è Airspaces

## Introduction

This is a personal project of Eric Taylor's to create custom OpenAIR airspace files to use while flying with [Gaggle](https://flygaggle.com/).

Gaggle uses [OpenAIP](https://www.openaip.net/) airspace database to display airspaces on their map. There are lots of missing airspaces in OpenAIP as it relates to the locations I fly in.

This project is setup to create custom OpenAIR airspace files that can be uploaded to Gaggle to display airspaces that are not in OpenAIP and fill in the gaps.

## How to use

1. Using the links below in "Airspace Files", download the custom airspace file you want to use to your phone with Gaggle installed.
2. Upload the airspace file to Gaggle by navigating the "Airspaces" section under the "Explore" tab. To upload the file you need to provide a name, description, and the airspace file itself. [See instructions](https://flygaggle.com/help/items/airspaces-personal/).
